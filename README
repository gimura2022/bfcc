NAME
     bfcc - brainfuck to C compiler

SYNOPSIS
     bfcc [-C] [-c] [-h] [-o file] [-S stack_size] [-g cc] [-e fn] [-p fn]
	  [-G fn] [-i fn] [-d fn] [-D fn] [-l library] [-z] [-s] [-f cflags]
	  [-v] [file ...]
     file

DESCRYPTION
     The bfcc is brainfuck compiler using c.

     -C	     compile to C source code.

     -c	     compile not linked object file.

     -h	     print usage.

     -o file
	     set output file name.

     -S stack_size
	     set brainfuck stack size, by default 30000.

     -g cc   set C compiler name.

     -e fn   set code entry point for runtime.

     -p fn   set runtime put function name.

     -G fn   set runtime get function name.

     -i fn   set runtime stack increment function name (it used only in stack
	     overflow checker, see -z).

     -d fn   set runtime stack decrement function name (it used only in stack
	     overflow checker, see -z).

     -d fn   set runtime stack dump function name.

     -l library
	     set runtime library.

     -z	     enable stack overflow checker, guarantees that the program can't
	     call undefined behaviour.

     -s	     print stack dump at end of program.

     -f cflags
	     set flags for c compiler.

     -v	     set verbose mode.

EXIT STATUS
     The bfcc utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

STANDARTS
     The bfcc utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1")
     specification and brainfuck language.

     "#" operator is extention used for debugging.

NOTES
     Programms compiled by bfcc require runtime library (by default libbfcc).

     You can install runtime without compiler, run "make runtime" with
     superuser rights.
